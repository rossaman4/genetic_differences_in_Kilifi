# Patterns-of-genetic-differences-in-Kilifi

Contains code and data from the paper:

Investigating the drivers of the spatio-temporal patterns of genetic differences between <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria infections in Kilifi County, Kenya. Malinga J, Mogeni P, Omedo I, Rockett K, Hubbart C, Jeffreys A, Williams T, Kwiatkowski D, Bejon P & Ross A. Scientific Reports <i>In press</i>

The code runs a simulation model of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria infections and fits it to genotyping data from Kilifi in order to estimate the mean distance between parent and offspring infections and to test simple hypotheses about drivers of the temporal and spatial genetic patterns observed.
